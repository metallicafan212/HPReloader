# HPReloader(Currently banned from runs)
Replicates the behavior of the window message reloading from the game.
The system in the game is there (I feel) to aid development of the orginal game as it allows you to keep a copy open, make a small change to a level, and hit play level without having to reinitialize the copy of the game.

For the time being, it's banned in speedrunning as it's 3rd party.
If it never gets unbanned, this will stay here as a proof of concept for (I think) the only Unreal Engine game that behaves this way.
